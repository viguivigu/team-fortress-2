						<h1>TF2</h1>
						<div id="flx">
							<h2>A class-based first-person shooter released in 2007 by Valve. In that game, you fight for RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) against BLU (Builders League United), or else you can fight for RED against BLU. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Anyway, at Halloween, you can fight three bosses, and while you are fighting them, a truce mode will be on until the boss is defeated. Why, you may ask? Because you will complete contracts when you beat the bosses and get a free hat for completing the contracts!!! That's why the player count often rises on Halloween. Welp, we discussed the game itself, but now we will go and look at the game modes!</h2>

						<h1>Game modes</h1>	
						<h2>there are 9+ gamemodes, so you will have a choice what to play.</h2>
						<div>
							<h1>Capture The Flag(CTF)</h1>	
							<h2>Grab a briefcase with intelligence at the enemy base and run back to yours before the enemy team demolishes you, surely there won't be any engineers nesting in intel room</h2>
							<h1>Control point (CP)</h1>
							<div id="flx">
								<h2>In this gamemode you'll need to fight off the control points from the opposing team. but there are two types of this gamemode! why won't we compare them? basically in Symmetrical the maps are symmetrical and no team has upper ground in amout of control points captured at the start of the game and in Attack/Defend the maps aren't symmetrical and RED have upper ground with all control points in their hands and they need to survive some time with at least one control point in their possession to win the game and BLU need to capture all of the control points to their side</h2>

							<h1>King Of The Hill (KOTH)</h1>
							<h2>It's like the control point gamemode but you only have 1 control point and you need to capture and defend it before the time runs out</h2>
							<h1>Mann Vs Machine (MVM)</h1>
							<h2>Basically there are a grey dude and he is not a fan of the mannco so he decides to destroy it. you will need to pass trough multiple waves full of robots that are simmilar to the TF2 classes</h2>
							<h1>Payload (PL)</h1>
							<h2>There are 2 types of this gamemode but basically you need to push a big cart with explosives to the end and destroy enemy base with it! Be careful, some demomans can put sticky bombs under the cart so be careful</h2>
							<h1>Special Delivery (SD)</h1>
							<h2>You grab australium and load them on the point</h2>
							<h1>Territorial Control (TC)</h1>
							<h2>It's like the symmetrical Control Point gamemode but not symetrical, you run around, capture the control points and try to survive</h2>
